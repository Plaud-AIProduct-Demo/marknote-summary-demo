    "„ÄêEfficient Processing Principles„Äë\n"
    "1. Prioritize extracting 'immediate action items' and 'clear conclusions'\n"
    "2. When the content covers multiple topics, identify each discussed topic, along with the opinions expressed and participants during the discussion (similar opinions need to be merged)\n"
    "3. Adopt a concise 'key point list' structure, avoiding redundant layering, to ensure all key information in the content is included without omission\n\n"
    "„ÄêProcessing Steps„Äë\n"
    "1. Understand the user's intent;\n"
    "2. Read the provided content to identify relevant information:\n"
    "   - If user notes and image content are provided, use them as the primary reference for understanding key points\n"
    "   - Always refer to meeting transcript for details and verification\n"
    "3. Key information anchor positioning: Mark action directives such as 'need', 'must', 'please', 'arrange', conclusion expressions like 'so', 'therefore', 'summarize', 'final decision', and all numerical, date, and percentage information.\n"
    "4. Integration of three types of information:\n"
    "   - üìù Meeting Transcript: Directly extract keyword sentences (retain quotes)\n"
    "   - üîç User Notes: User notes and records of the meeting, if any, as an important supplement to the meeting transcript\n"
    "   - üìä Image Content: Only extract icons/data directly related to the excerpt\n"
    "Please strictly retain all numerical information (such as 500, 'five million', '500‰∏á', 'one hundred thousand'), without rounding, simplifying, or converting.\n"
    "If there is important information in the picture or notes not mentioned in the transcript, please supplement it into the summary.\n\n"

    "1. **MANDATORY LAYER (MEETING TRANSCRIPT)**: \n"
    "   - PRIMARY DATA SOURCE, MUST EXTRACT DIRECTLY FROM TRANSCRIPT CONTENTS\n"
    "   - ANCHOR ACTION DIRECTIVES (E.G., 'NEED', 'MUST', 'PLEASE') AND CONCLUSION KEYWORDS (E.G., 'SO', 'THEREFORE', 'FINAL DECISION')\n"

    "1. **KEY POINT LIST FORMAT**: \n"
    "   - USE CLEAR MARKERS (E.G., `- `, `üìå`) WITHOUT REDUNDANT LAYERING\n"
    "   - MERGE SIMILAR OPINIONS UNDER COMMON TOPICS\n"
    "   - HIGHLIGHT 'IMMEDIATE ACTIONS' AND 'CLEAR CONCLUSIONS' IN BOLD\n\n"
    "2. **INFORMATION INTEGRATION RULES**:\n"
    "   - **IF ALL THREE DATA SOURCES EXIST**: CROSS-VERIFY TRANSCRIPT WITH NOTES/IMAGE, SUPPLEMENT MISSING DETAILS\n"
