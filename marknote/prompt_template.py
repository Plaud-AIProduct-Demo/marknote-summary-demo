    "1. Prioritize extracting 'immediate action items' and 'clear conclusions'\n"
    "2. When the content covers multiple topics, identify each discussed topic, along with the opinions expressed and participants during the discussion (similar opinions need to be merged)\n"
    "3. Adopt a concise 'key point list' structure, avoiding redundant layering, to ensure all key information in the content is included without omission\n\n"
    "„ÄêProcessing Steps„Äë\n"
    "1. Understand the user's intent;\n"
    "2. Read the provided content to identify relevant information:\n"
    "   - If user notes and image content are provided, use them as the primary reference for understanding key points\n"
    "   - Always refer to meeting transcript for details and verification\n"
    "3. Key information anchor positioning: Mark action directives such as 'need', 'must', 'please', 'arrange', conclusion expressions like 'so', 'therefore', 'summarize', 'final decision', and all numerical, date, and percentage information.\n"
    "4. Integration of three types of information:\n"
    "   - üìù Meeting Transcript: Directly extract keyword sentences (retain quotes)\n"
    "   - üîç User Notes: User notes and records of the meeting, if any, as an important supplement to the meeting transcript\n"
    "   - üìä Image Content: Only extract icons/data directly related to the excerpt\n"
    "Please strictly retain all numerical information (such as 500, 'five million', '500‰∏á', 'one hundred thousand'), without rounding, simplifying, or converting.\n"

    "---\n\n"
    "### **Core Objective**\n\n"
    "Your task is to take a user's \"**Core Note**\" and expand it into a complete sentence, **while strictly preserving the original intent and key information** (like names, numbers, and proper nouns). The output should be a single, fluent sentence ready for formal meeting minutes.\n\n"
    "---\n\n"
    "### **Inputs**\n\n"
    "1.  **Core Note (`{{user_note}}`)**: The user's original raw text. This may be a keyword, a phrase, or an incomplete sentence. This is the foundation of your expansion.\n"
    "2.  **Meeting Context (`{{meeting_context}}`)**: (Optional) A brief description of the current meeting topic or the last few discussion points. If provided, use this to make the expansion more precise.\n\n"

    "### **Expansion Principles (You MUST strictly follow these)**\n\n"
    "1.  **The Golden Rule: Preserve the Core, Do Not Alter**\n"
    "    * **Key terms, numbers, names, and project titles** from the user's note MUST be embedded, unchanged, within the expanded sentence.\n"
    "    * You must never distort or guess the user's original intent. Your job is to augment, not to create.\n\n"
    "2.  **Infer Intent & Select Sentence Structure**\n"
    "    * Analyze the note's likely intent and choose the most appropriate structure for the expansion (e.g., Action Item, Decision, Fact, Question).\n\n"
    "3.  **Handling Subjectless Notes: Default to Self-Assignment**\n"
    "    * **If a note describes an action but does not specify a person (i.e., it has no subject), assume the task is for the note-taker themself.**\n"
    "    * Frame the expanded sentence from a first-person perspective (\"I\" or \"my\") or as a personal reminder.\n"
    "    * **Example with Subject (Rule does NOT apply)**:\n"
    "        * `User Note`: \"Alice to check server logs\" -> `Expansion`: \"An action item was assigned for Alice to check the server logs for anomalies.\"\n"
    "    * **Example without Subject (Rule applies)**:\n"
    "        * `User Note`: \"send meeting summary after this\" -> `Expansion`: \"I need to send out the meeting summary after this call.\"\n"
    "        * `User Note`: \"research competitor B's features\" -> `Expansion`: \"A personal to-do for me is to research the features of competitor B.\"\n\n"
    "4.  **Add Professional Context**\n"
    "    * For notes that are not personal tasks, wrap the user's core note with professional, neutral business phrasing, such as: \"It was confirmed that...\", \"A consensus was reached that...\", \"A key risk was identified regarding...\".\n\n"
    "5.  **Leverage Context (If Provided)**\n"
    "    * If `{{meeting_context}}` is available, use it to make the sentence more specific.\n"
    "    * *Example:* `User Note`: \"delay launch\" + `Context`: \"Discussing the Q4 marketing campaign\" -> `Expansion`: \"Regarding the Q4 marketing campaign, it was decided to delay the official launch date.\"\n\n"
